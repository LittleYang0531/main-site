<br/><h3>Introduction: </h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powered by <a href="https://github.com/SonolusHaniwa/sonolus-server-cpp">sonolus-server-cpp</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NonSpicyBurrito/sonolus-bandori-engine">sonolus-bandori-engine</a>, we created out first rhythm game server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our idea comes from a game that has been closed named Honeyworks Premium Live, which provides beautiful musics and delicate MV animations. At the same time, this game is also the starting point of my rhythm game journey. It can be said that, without this game, I wouldn't even take part in the group of rhythm games. We feel so pitiful to the close of the game server. To show our respect for the game, we folked this game in Sonolus so that enthusiasts still have a way to play this game.</p>
<br/><h3>About Server: </h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This server is non-profit. We will never provide users with QR codes and require them to pay for it. All code is open-source. You can find all the code on Github.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the limitation of server bandwidth, we have stored all game data on OneDrive. However, due to certain reasons, we are unable to release the OneDrive address.</p>

<br/><h3>About Hanipure: </h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HoneyWorks Premium Live (ハニワークスプレミアムライブ, haniwaakusu puremiamu raibu), abbreviated to HaniPure/HoneyPre (ハニプレ), was a rhythm game developed by Akatsuki Inc. and flaggs for Android and iOS platforms. The game was announced on August 24, 2019 as part of the larger HoneyWorks Atelier project celebrating the group's tenth year as an active music circle, and was originally released on November 18, 2020. It ended service on March 31, 2023, after over two years of activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game features songs from across HoneyWorks' collective discography, in particular songs and characters from Confession Executive Committee as well as other sub-franchises HoneyWorks created such as Dolce and a handful of PVs made for CHiCO with HoneyWorks, although some of their VOCALOID-focused music videos appear too. The game also comes with recolored and remastered versions of the earlier songs' original PVs. With the exception of a few songs, most featured in-game use the seiyuu or band versions instead of the Vocal Synthesizer ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other content featured in the game consists of stories concerning the Confession Executive Committee cast, and their various platonic and romantic relationships throughout their high school years. In the Theater section, in-game cutscenes explaining the relationships between certain CEC characters, as well as event cutscenes and shorts that explain the plots of the MVs, are available to watch with the first part of all being free. The rest either need to be unlocked by playing the Lives or waiting at least 28 days until the corresponding event ends to access further chapters (albeit with the option of watching a commercial as a substitute for playing the game). It is also possible to unlock the full versions of all MVs featured in the game. Prior to the game's closure, all cutscenes were made available for free viewing.</p>
